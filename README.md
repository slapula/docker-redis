docker-redis
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wangsha/docker-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wangsha/docker-redis)

Ansible role to manage and run the redis docker container.

Requirements
------------

This role has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04. Since this uses Ansible's
docker module, you will need to ensure that a recent-ish version of `docker-py`
and `docker` are installed.

Examples
--------

Install this module from Ansible Galaxy into the './roles' directory:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install wangsha.docker-redis -p ./roles
```

Use it in a playbook as follows, assuming you already have docker setup:
```yaml
- hosts: 'servers'
  roles:
    - role: 'wangsha.docker-redis'
      become: true
```

Have a look at the [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) for role variables
that can be overridden! If you need a playbook to set Docker itself, have a
look at
[wangsha.docker](https://github.com/wangsha/docker-redis) Galaxy
role.
